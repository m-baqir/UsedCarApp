# UsedCarApp Passion Project
A database driven app that allows users to post new ads for vehicles they wish to sell.
So far the app has full CRUD functionality for Cars, Users, and Ads.
This app has a responsive design
There is an additional feature to upload and store images related to ads on the server.

TODO:
- Create functionality for users to register and login
- Transfer the 'User' Model into the 'ApplicationUser.cs' class that's defined in IdentityModel.cs
- Create functionality for users to send message/email within the site
- Incorporate a image gallery so each ad can have mutiple images associated with it
- Work on a search feature to be able to quickly find cars based on year, make, or model
